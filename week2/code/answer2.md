##### Besides the examples listed in the code and the reading, what might the wrapped NFT pattern be used for?

Wrapped NFTs could be useful in many situations.
A NFT project which is implementing any kind of staking, could allow the NFT owners to get a wrapped NFT after depositing the NFT into the staking contract (to access governance, earn yield or anything else). This would increment the "capital efficiency" of the asset, and the owner could be able to use the same NFT in other DeFi protocols, such as collateral in a lending platform or keep it listed on a marketplace without renouncing the benefits of the staking while he awaits to find a buyer.
